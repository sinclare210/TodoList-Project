## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

This project, was built using tailwind css, i learnt about grid-cols, this tailwind property helps you control the number of card you want to see on a row depending on the screen size.

Secondly, i learnt about javascript dom, because it was used to build the mobile navbar.


### Continued development

I need to work on Tailwind css postioning, it was the main issue on the project. It was tiresome.
