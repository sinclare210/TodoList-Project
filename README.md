## My process

### Built with

- Jsx
- Tailwind CSS
- React




### What I learned

I learnt about usestate which is use to hold information, like a virtual storage, till the data is refreshed. I also learnt about props which is use to pass information from one component to another,


### Continued development

I would need o build more project with react to solidify my knowledge with usestate.
